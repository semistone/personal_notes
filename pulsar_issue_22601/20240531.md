### Check corrupted data


#### unwrap data
first I confirmed the memory address before/after are the same.

then try to read those data.
- [origin unwrap data](unwrap_ok.bin)
- [corrupted unwrap data](unwrap_ng.bin)
- [diff](unwrap_diff.png)

I check in unwrap data,
- data 400 is long payload
- data 401 is current small payload and it's last entry before send to bookkeeper.
- corrupted unwrap have data 403/404/405 means another thread is keep writing.
- I checked few logs and corrupt data always follow by long payload and sometimes it will corrupt more than one records.


I could see data 401 is still there and not corrupted, 
that's why I get wrong conclusion that unwrap data didn't corrupt in previous test but some index was wrong.

but actually payload 401 still there and it have shifted the position.

to me it's interesting, netty not only read/write buffer, but it will move the data
I think it's cause by that SSH handler which you had fixed.
